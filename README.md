# A-Comprehensive-Analysis-and-Visualization-of-COVID-19
Analyzing 2020-2021 COVID-19 data. Python, Airflow orchestration, Pandas for transformation, and BigQuery for loading. Visualized insights with Power BI
I led a comprehensive COVID-19 data analysis, orchestrating a robust pipeline with Python, Airflow, and BigQuery. Leveraging requests, Pandas, and BigQuery libraries, I seamlessly extracted, preprocessed, and loaded data. Apache Airflow ensured synchronized orchestration.
Additionally, I visualized key insights with Power BI, creating compelling representations. Demonstrating expertise in Python, data engineering, and workflow orchestration, I translated raw data into meaningful, actionable insights.
